Goals included contact from, newsletter, blog and products page. Here I had to create a backend app that can handle all the API calls safely without exposing sensitive data. Website is to be deployed on a VPS such as DigitalOcean to challenge myself learning new skills as well as keeping the costs down so client and server side can be launched on a single low cost VPS. The project will be delivered before the new year. Here is a video of current progress. Also codes are being pushed on my github repository as I am working on it.',
